/**
 * A set of specifications for copying files.  This includes:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>source directories (multiples allowed)
 *   <li>destination directory
 *   <li>ANT like include patterns
 *   <li>ANT like exclude patterns
 *   <li>File relocating rules
 *   <li>renaming rules
 *   <li>content filters
 * </ul>
 *
 * CopySpecs may be nested by passing a closure to one of the from methods.  The
 * closure creates a child CopySpec and delegates methods in the closure to the child.
 * Child CopySpecs inherit any values specified in the parent.  Only the leaf CopySpecs
 * will be used in any copy operations.
 * This allows constructs like:
 * <pre>
 * into('webroot')
 * exclude('**&#47;.svn/**')
 * from('src/main/webapp') {
 *    include '**&#47;*.jsp'
 * }
 * from('src/main/js') {
 *    include '**&#47;*.js'
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * In this example, the <code>into</code> and <code>exclude</code> specifications at the
 * root level are inherited by the two child CopySpecs.
